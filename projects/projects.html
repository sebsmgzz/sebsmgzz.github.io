              Students developed diverse medical prototypes from scratch in order to solve a medical problematic during the mixing of chemical substances for a dental application. In order to do this, the students had to apply the 'Design Thniking' model during a bootcamp and workshop we developed on the company with collaboration with the university.

              I was involved in the manufacturing with the CNC milling machine. This included explaining the students the milling process, considerations for their design and the limitations of the machine. The designs  had to be reviewed and proposals for improvement had to be done, this also had to take in account the cost of material and the time involved in each process.

        <h2>Pro active actitud</h2>
        <p>
          I have been described several times as proactive. Mainly in the office with coworkers and bosses who seem to notice my self-teaching attitude. But also, by friends and family with whom I socialize daily, since they always ask: Why am I so busy? Why doesn't all that work overwhelm me? To which I answer that I simply like learning new things. As simple as may be learning from history from a book or novel, to really focusing and learning a new programming language, I enjoy the journey and simply cannot get enough.

        <h2>Look up for the future</h2>
        <p>
          What value can I apport to the company? Short answer, my way of thinking. Long answer, everyone's way of thinking. Sure, I could go on and explain how I am an out-of-the-box thinker and how easily I can get along with people, but rather than doing that, let me tell you why my combination of thoughts combined with my personality traits are exactly what you need. First, yes, I have a more abstract way of thinking, I have loved puzzles and solving mind-tricking games ever since I was a child. The harder I must think, the better. But that does not stop there since I also like teaching and explaining others how to get them to an answer. How is that you ask? Well let me tell you with a simple example. During college, I used to have long study sessions, not for myself, but for other students that where struggling with some topic. And during this session I did not focused on doing the homework for them, but rather teach them how to approach problem solving. Either structured linear steps to tackle the problem or a messy brainstorm of ideas that later turned into an innovative answer to the problem. Sometimes, even those some students turned out to have better grades than myself, and I could not be prouder for them. So you see, it is not only my way of thinking, but how I can share that way of thinking with others in the team, and then they would share their strategies with other teams and the growth would be exponential.

        <h2>+3 years experience before graduating</h2>
        <p>
          Ever since I was in high school, I have been on business relating activities, from a waiter, to mechanic technician, to software developer. This several experiences have allowed me to connect with different kinds of people, therefore I can, and have already, recognized previous situations in different circumstances as I have been working on different level positions. Because the circumstances that a low-level position, such as waiter afront daily are quite different from a high-level position, such as software developer. But when there is a background and knowledge of this circumstances and possible problems that <span>may</span> will arise, then it is much easier to have a communication among the team, because there may be different levels on the business personal, but all of them are part of the same team.

        <h2>Organized and focused</h2>
        <p>
          Another trait that describes me is my organization, which also helps me do several projects at the time. Since after figuring out the working structure of a project, it is easier to keep track of pending tasks and important dates, to know if I am on time with schedule or if I am behind on it. I consider this incredible valuable information, since my efficiency on other projects will depend on the time invested, which is more manageable when you have a structure behind every project. Been said that, this can be exploited and go beyond time management, but also we have to take care not to fall into a planning-hole, in which you just plan and plan and keep planning, resulting in no work done. Balancing takes experience, which if you have seen my projects, you know I have.

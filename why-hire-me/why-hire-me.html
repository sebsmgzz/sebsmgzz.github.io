        <h2>Pro active actitud</h2>
        <p>
          I have been described several times as proactive. Mainly in the office with coworkers and bosses who seem to notice my continues self-teaching actitued. But also by friends and family with whom I socialise on a daily basis, since they always ask: Why am i so busy? Why doesn't all that work overwellms me? To which I answer that i simply like learnigng new things. As simple as may be learning from history from a book or novel, to really focusing and learning a new programming language, I enjoy the journey and simply can't get enough.

        <h2>Look up for the future</h2>
        <p>
          What value can I apport to the company? Short answer, my way of thinking. Long answer, everyone's my way of thinking. Sure, I could go on and explain how I am an out-of-the-box thinker and how easily I can get along with people, but rather than doing that, let me tell you why my combination of thoughs combined with my personality traits are exaclty what you need. First of all, yes I have a more abstract way of thinking, I have loved puzzles and solving mind-tricking games ever since I was a child. The harder I have to think, the better. But that doesn't stops there, since I also like teaching and explaining others how to get the to an answer. How is that you ask? Well let me tell you with a simple example. During college, I used to have long study sessions, not for myself, but for other students that where struggling with some topic. And during this sessions I didn't focused  on doing the homework for them, but rather teach them how to approach problem solving. Either strucured linear steps to tackle the problem or a messy brainstorm of ideas that later turned into an innovative answer to the problem. Sometimes, even those some students turned out to have better grades than myself, and I could not be prouder for them. So you see, it is not only my way of thinking, but how I can share that way of thinking with others in the team, and then they would share their strategies with other teams and the growth would be exponential.

        <h2>+3 years experience before graduating</h2>
        <p>
          Ever since i was in high school I have been on bussines relating activities, from a waitter, to mechanic technitian, to software developer. This several experiences have allowed me to connect with different kinds of people, therefore I can, an have already, recognized previous situations in different circunstances as i have been working on different level positions. Because the circumstances that a low level position, such as waitter afront daily are very different from a high level position, such as software developer. But when there is a background and knowledge of this circumstances and possible problems that <del>may</del> will arrise, then it is much easier to have a communication among the team, because there may be different levels on the bussines personal, but all of them are part of the same team.

        <h2>Organized and focused</h2>
        <p>
          Another trait that describes me is my organization, which also helps me do several proyects at the time. Since after figuring out the working structure of a proyect, it's easier to keep track of pending tasks and important dates, to know if I am on time with schedule or if I am behind on it. I consider this incredible valuable information, since my eficiency on other proyects will depend on the time invested, which is more managable when you have a structure behind every proyect. Been said that, this can be exploited and go beyond time managment, but also we have to take care not to fall into a planning-hole, in which you just plan and plan and keep planning, resulting in no work done. Balancing takes experience, which if you have seen my proyects, you know I have.

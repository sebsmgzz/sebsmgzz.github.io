        dates: "September 2019 - June 2020",
        description: "As an electric harness designer, I was assigned to several teams to provide support in technical drawings and 3D CAD models development. Also, I provided a digital solution to aid in the design of these drawings to avoid recurrent steps of the process and help reach compliance of standards. The solution included a C# implementation through which the engineers could load a data report from their CAD design software to be analysed and then get feedback on their design in realtion to the compliance policies. Also, when determining the cost of components from different providers, another tool (a web scrapper) was developed to help gather the correct information throughout the web and reduce time in proyect cost estimations."

        description: "As a visual basic developer, I started in the company to develop a digital solution to automate the manufacture design of plastic inyection molds. The solution was a desktop application which automated the input informat from the current design, and after selecting the desired platic inyection machine, the parameters for the calculations were loaded from a local database and performed the corresponding markups on the inputs to signal the faults or possible improvements for the process. Allowing the user (design engineer) to have instant feedback on their design, select the manufacture machine more properly, and increase the quality on the resulting products."

The printer was working with a new type of polymer previously designed by another team for innovative solution in the protesis manufacture area. The printing optimization of the polymer was achieved through extensive testing for data gathering to develop a mathematic model for each parameter. After the models were obtained, the point of optimization was easily obtained."

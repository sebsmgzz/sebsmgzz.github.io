    Issue?
        Scroller 'jumps' to next row when button is clicked. It should transition slowly.
    Idea?
        Since the scroller buttons function through JS, implementing JS animation.

    Issue?
        .dropdown.open limits the height with max-height set to a value, instead of being auto. Which can't because then the transition doesn't works properly.
    Idea?
        Position .contents on top of the .clicker and change it's position rather than the .dropdown height property. So the .dropdown height can be left auto. But then you have to play around with the position of .contents to hidde it without altering the height of .dropdown when hidden.

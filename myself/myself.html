          <p>
            I am 23 years old recently graduated in Mechanic Electric Engineering.  I'm passionatly about technology, specially automating processes, from there my love for codding and system's control. Ever since i was a child i wanted to know how everything worked. I remember being playing with my xbox during a storm when i was just a child, and suddenly a lighting striked and smoke came out the voltage regulator. I didn't wanted anyone else to fix it, so i went on and openned the plastic container and managed to replace a burned component (at the time i didn't know it was a capacitor). After that i tought i should connect it to verify if it worked properly before clossing it for good. As unexperienced as i was, i pluged it to the light soket while holding the uncaged system with my bare hands. Needless to say that those kind of experiences are never forgetted. And my childhood is full with experiences like that (not always finishing in electric discharges) but rather than learning how to fix, chargers, phones, voltage regulators, etc.
